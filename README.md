# Key-Fx ⌨️🔊
### A script to be able to customize your keyboard by adding Sfx

## Features
* 2️⃣**Dual-action key detection** Unlike other soundboards, this one plays a key press sound and a key release sound for a more immersive experience
* 🌎**Global system hook** This means that you can use any app while this runs in the background
* 🪶**Lightweight** Uses a couple MB of RAM (especially during rampocalypse) and 0-3% of CPUs on most computers
* 🔢**Many sounds** KFX boasts a large quantity of keyboard sounds
* ⚙️Customizable soundpacks (unavailable at this moment)
* 🌿**Simple GUI** A GUI so simple, it's hard to mess things up.
* 📈**Concurrency & window management** Only opens 1 window of each type to prevent overlapping sounds and performance issues (Although performance issues are rare)

## Quick start

* Choose a soundpack to play
* You're all set! 👍
